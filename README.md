# Horiseon Search Engine Optimization

## This is a code refactor project for my Bootcamp out of University North Carolina Charlotte. 

## The objective is to refactor the code to reflect semantic elements and attributes, also improving the pages accessibility by adding descriptive alt attributes to be better read by screen readers.
