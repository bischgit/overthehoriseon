# Horiseon Search Engine Optimization

## This is a code refactor project for my Bootcamp out of University North Carolina Charlotte. 

## The objective is to refactor the code to reflect semantic elements and attributes, also improving the pages accessibility by adding descriptive alt attributes to be better read by screen readers.<img width="1421" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-07 at 12 48 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101281767/167263954-14998251-657b-41fc-bcd9-7b522485183f.png">
